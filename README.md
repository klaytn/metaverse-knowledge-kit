# NO LONGER MAINTAINED

Since the launch of Kaia Blockchain this repository has been parked in favour of the new open-source projects in [Kaia's Github]. Contributors have now moved there continuing with massive open-source contributions to our blockchain ecosystem. A big thank you to everyone who has contributed to this repository. For more information about Klaytn's chain merge with Finschia blockchain please refer to the launching of Kaia blockchain - [kaia.io](http://kaia.io/).

# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```
$ USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
