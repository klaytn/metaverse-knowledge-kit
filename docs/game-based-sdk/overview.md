## Overview <a id="Gaming SDKs Overview"></a>

The recent surge of interest in NFTs has led to many game developers recognizing the value that NFTs can bring to the gaming industry. Traditionally, game developers have used game engines like Unity/Unreal to build their games. However, integrating these game engines with the blockchain layer, such as Klaytn, has been a challenge due to the lack of a bridge between the two. 

This challenge created a need to build infrastructure that enables game developers to seamlessly integrate with the crypto ecosystem and hence, the development of Web3 gaming SDKs. These SDKs allow game developers to create use cases around NFTs, play-to-earn, GameFi, and more. Additionally, these tools are essential for builders of the Metaverse who need the best possible tools to create the next generation of metaverse gaming applications. 

With the use of SDKs, game developers can easily integrate the following capabilities into their metaverse gaming applications: 

* Web3 wallet support for in-game transactions 
* NFT capabilities like minting, renting, and trading 
* In-game currency token launch and distribution 
* Mobile optimization for Web3 game elements  

## Use cases <a id="Gaming SDKs Usecase"></a>
Web3 gaming SDKs serve the purpose of creating a bridge between gaming engines and the blockchain. By providing the necessary tools for developers, they can seamlessly integrate their gaming applications into any crypto ecosystem. [ChainSafe](https://docs.gaming.chainsafe.io/) is an example of a Klaytn-integrated gaming SDK that enables developers to build blockchain-enabled metaverse gaming applications.

An example of Web3 gaming SDKs being used is [Arsenal](https://arsenal.fabwelt.com/), a 3D first-person battleground shooter game, which utilizes a gaming SDK to allow players to connect to a blockchain wallet and access in-game NFTs for pay-to-play and play-to-earn features.
